Introduction
============

| Inspired by `Ready Player One`_ and the concept of 3D Internet.
| We wanted to create a space where many different worlds would be connected into one universe ðŸŒŒ
| And those worlds can be made and hosted by everyone.

.. _Ready Player One: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)


What is TheGates?
-----------------
| **TheGates** is a new web ecosystem focused on building communities, social gaming, and experiences, built with `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org/>`__.
| It connects game experiences together like the World Wide Web and allows you to easily access them without installing.
|
| Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS

3D Internet
-----------
| We imagine the internet as a shared 3D space with physics where people and organizations can interact, learn, and create together â€” not just click through 2D pages.
| TheGates connects standalone Godot projects into a browsable network of worlds.

Why it matters
--------------
| Meeting people in a 3D space and interacting beyond text can be a powerful experience for community and learning.

Vision
------
| 3D spaces evolve into hubs for hanging out, games, music, art, and live shows. 
| Learning becomes more immersive and efficient through interactive worlds. 
| This shift sparks a new ecosystem of internet projects and innovation.

How does it work?
-----------------

Itâ€™s very similar to the Internet \(World Wide Web\):

#. You type a link of the world you wanna visit.
#. TheGates browser downloads all the necessary files and opens them.
#. Inside this world, you can find other links/portals and follow them.
 
| While the Web is built of HTML and JavaScript.
| We have **Godot Engine** that provides similar functionality.


Why does Godot Engine work like HTML and JavaScript?
----------------------------------------------------

Godot uses scenes to describe objects and GDScript to make them behave, so:

.. code-block:: ini

   Scenes (saved to tscn file) = html files.
   GDScript = javascript.

| And the magic here is that Godot can export project files in .pck or .zip format.
| Then it can load the exported file and run it right away âœ¨
