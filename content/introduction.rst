Introduction
============

| Inspired by `Ready Player One`_ and the concept of 3D Internet.
  We wanted to create some space where many different worlds will be connected together into one universe ðŸŒŒ
| And those worlds can be made and hosted by everyone.

.. _Ready Player One: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)


So how is that works?
---------------------

It's very similar to internet \(world wide web\):

#. You type a link of the world you wanna visit.
#. TheGates browser downloads all the necessary files and opens it.
#. Inside this world you can find another links/portals and follow them.
 
| While Web is build of html and javascript.
| We have **Godot Engine** that provides similar functionality.


Why Godot Engine works like html and javascript?
------------------------------------------------

Godot uses scenes to describe objects and gdscript to make them behave, so:

.. code-block:: ini

   Scenes (saved to tscn file) = html files.
   GDScript = javascript.

| And the magic here is that godot can export project files into pck or zip.
| Then it can load exported file and run it right away âœ¨
