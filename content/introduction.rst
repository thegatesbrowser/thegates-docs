Introduction
============

| Inspired by Ready Player One and the concept of 3D Internet.
  We wanted to create some space where many different worlds will be connected together into one universe ðŸŒŒ
| And those worlds can be made and hosted by everyone.


So how is that done?
--------------------

It's very similar to how internet (Web) works:

#. You type a link of the page you wanna visit.
#. Browser downloads all the necessary files and opens it.
#. Here you can find another links and follow them.
 
| While Web is build of html and javascript.
| We have Godot Engine that provides similar functionality.


Why Godot Engine works like html and javascript?
------------------------------------------------

Godot uses scenes to describe objects and gdscript to make them behave, so:

* Scenes (saved to \*.tscn file) == html files.
* GDScript == javascript.

| And a little magic thing is that godot can export project files into .pck or zip.
| Then it can load exported files and run them right away âœ¨
