Introduction
============

| Inspired by `Ready Player One`_ and the concept of 3D Internet.
| We wanted to create a space where many different worlds would be connected into one universe ðŸŒŒ
| And those worlds can be made and hosted by everyone.

How does it work?
-----------------

Itâ€™s very similar to the Internet \(World Wide Web\):

#. You type a link of the world you wanna visit.
#. TheGates browser downloads all the necessary files and opens them.
#. Inside this world, you can find other links/portals and follow them.
 
| While the Web is built of HTML and JavaScript.
| We have **Godot Engine** that provides similar functionality.


Why does Godot Engine work like HTML and JavaScript?
----------------------------------------------------

Godot uses scenes to describe objects and GDScript to make them behave, so:

.. code-block:: ini

   Scenes (saved to tscn file) = html files.
   GDScript = javascript.

| And the magic here is that Godot can export project files in .pck or .zip format.
| Then it can load the exported file and run it right away âœ¨
