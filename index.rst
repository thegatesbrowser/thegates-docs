TheGates Docs
====================================

| **TheGates** is a free and open-source 3D internet browser built with `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org/>`__.
| It connects game experiences together like the World Wide Web and allows you to easily access them without installing.
| 
| Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS

3D Internet
------------

| We imagine the internet as a shared 3D space with physics where people and organizations can interact, learn, and create together â€” not just click through 2D pages.
| TheGates connects standalone Godot projects into a browsable network of worlds.

Why it matters
--------------

| Meeting people in a 3D space and interacting beyond text can be a powerful experience for community and learning.

Our vision
----------

| 3D spaces evolve into hubs for hanging out, games, music, art, and live shows. 
| Learning becomes more immersive and efficient through interactive worlds. 
| This shift sparks a new ecosystem of internet projects and innovation.

What we've built
----------------

| The project is live today. Download the 3D browser, visit an online multiplayer hub, and explore community projects. Anyone can host their own worlds by following the docs.
| Everything is open-source: see the repositories and join the community.
